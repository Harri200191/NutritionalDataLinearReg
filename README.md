The same notebook can be found on Kaggle as well. Don't forget to leave it a like and share your thoughts with me!

The data set, although not suitable for linear regression, performed quite well by attaining a 79% R2 value! It enabled the questions being asked in the main csv file to be answered! I'm open to any suggestions and improvements that you might want to give! After all, we're all learning!
